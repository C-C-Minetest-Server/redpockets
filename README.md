# Happy Chinese New Year!
Want to celebrate the festival in-game? Now you can give out [red pockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_envelope) right in Minetest!

## Installation
Select and download this mod in the ContentDB menu of Minetest Engine. The optional dependency, the Currency mod, should be installed in order for the mod to work properly. If the Currency mod is absent, red pockets can only act as a decoration item.

To enable crafting, Minetest Game, which includes the Default and the Dye mod, is needed. Mesecons, which provides glue via its Materials sub-mod, can be used to add glue into the recipe.
